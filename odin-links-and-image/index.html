<!-- 
    noopener = prevents the open link from gaining access to the webpage from which it opened.
        --prevents phising attacks (tabnabbing = changes the original webpage to a different one to trick users)
    noreferrer = prevents the open link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or 'reference') to it.
        
    it is good coding practie to always pair target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer"
